### Hi 👋, I'm Shahrzad!

<p>
I'm a <strong>Junior Full Stack Software Engineer</strong> with almost 2 years of experience working in a small, agile team where I got to wear many hats—from building front-end features to working on back-end services, databases, and cloud deployments ☁️.  
</p>

<p>
I hold a <strong>Master’s degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering</strong>, and during my studies I explored projects in <em>AI, Machine Learning, and Image Processing 🤖</em>. Along the way, I picked up experience in building web apps and experimenting with different technologies.  
</p>

<p>
Right now, I’m focusing on <strong>personal projects</strong> to sharpen my skills, discover my specialization, and keep learning 🚀. I’m passionate about turning ideas into useful tools and love exploring new challenges in tech.  
</p>

<p>✨ Always curious. Always building. Always learning. ✨</p>
